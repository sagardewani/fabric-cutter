## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ **Zero-Leftover Optimization**
- Advanced algorithm that prioritizes achieving zero fabric waste
- Smart combination testing to find perfect cutting solutions
- Falls back to minimal waste if zero leftover isn't possible

### üìä **Priority-Based System**
- High-demand fabric sizes (‚â•15% probability) are always included
- Low-demand sizes can be excluded if they prevent zero leftover
- Proportional distribution based on weekly demand probabilities

### üîß **Customizable Demand Settings**
- Edit weekly demand for each fabric size
- Visual priority indicators (‚≠ê for high-priority sizes)
- Real-time probability calculations and updates

### üé® **Beautiful UI**
- Clean, modern interface with intuitive controls
- Results sorted by piece count for better visibility
- Smart number formatting (no unnecessary decimals)
- Success celebrations when zero leftover is achieved

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fabric-calc
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in terminal)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` folder, ready for deployment.

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Enter Fabric Length**: Input the total length of fabric you want to cut (e.g., 32.5 meters)

2. **Customize Demand Settings**: Click on fabric size cards to edit weekly demand numbers
   - Sizes with ‚â•15% probability become "Priority" (marked with ‚≠ê)
   - Priority sizes are always included in calculations
   - Optional sizes may be excluded for zero leftover

3. **Calculate**: Click "Calculate Optimal Cuts" to get your cutting plan

4. **View Results**: 
   - Cut plan sorted by number of pieces (highest first)
   - Summary showing total used, pieces, and leftover
   - Special celebration banner for zero leftover achievements

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Development**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

## üßÆ Algorithm Details

The calculator uses a sophisticated multi-step optimization process:

1. **Priority Classification**: Separates fabric sizes into priority (‚â•15%) and optional (<15%) categories
2. **Zero-Leftover Search**: Attempts to find combinations that use exactly all fabric
3. **Proportional Distribution**: Calculates target pieces based on demand probabilities
4. **Smart Bounds**: Sets reasonable limits to prevent small sizes from dominating
5. **Fallback Strategy**: Minimizes waste when perfect solutions aren't possible

## üìù Example

For 32.5m of fabric with default demand settings:
- **Input**: 32.5 meters
- **Optimal Result**: 6√ó2.5m + 4√ó3m + 2√ó2.25m + 1√ó1m = 32.5m
- **Leftover**: 0m (Perfect cut! üéØ)

## üé® Default Fabric Sizes

| Size | Weekly Demand | Probability | Priority |
|------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| 2.5m | 10 pieces | 33.3% | ‚≠ê Priority |
| 3m | 7 pieces | 23.3% | ‚≠ê Priority |
| 2.25m | 5 pieces | 16.7% | ‚≠ê Priority |
| 2m | 4 pieces | 13.3% | Optional |
| 5m | 3 pieces | 10.0% | Optional |
| 1m | 1 piece | 3.3% | Optional |

## üîß Configuration

You can modify the default fabric sizes in `src/utils/fabricCalculator.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_FABRIC_SIZES: FabricSize[] = [
  { size: 2.5, weeklyDemand: 10, probability: 0 },
  { size: 3, weeklyDemand: 7, probability: 0 },
  // ... add your custom sizes
];
```

- Custom favicon with scissors and fabric theme
- Web app manifest for installation
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
